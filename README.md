# Anti-Vanquisher
Anti-Vanquisher is a game about one or two flames (if in co-op) that don't want to get vanquished. The problem is that a hellish bullet hell of watery projectiles are on their toes.

Ranging from:
- Normal water drops that just follow their line
- Waterstreams that are fired from the top of the stage and stay for a while
- Snow flakes which freeze the flame in place without causing a game over
- Chaos balls that switch their direction or not
- Homing balls - by far the hardest - that follow the players if they get into its detection range
